This project's is about a vienna based student fraternity called "K.Ã–.H.V. Mercuria". This should be a web app to manage the drink tabs. There should be a session that can be opened for a night, with usually two member bartenders. These bartenders should be able to place orders for the members of this fraternity. Every couple of months, the members will pay up. The front-end should be built with ShaDcn components. There should only be one session at a time. There should be bar tenders added to a session. And there should be estimated times on how long the bartenders work on the session. There should be a drinks collection with prices. The app must be only accessible after user login. Admins can change stuff in the payload backend. The app should have three main pages, being a price list page, information page about the current session and a member's page. The members should have first name, last name and sort of a "nickname" called "coleuranme". Memo should also have a profile picture. Ottmins should be able to register and mange new members. There are two distinct "ranks". "Bursche" and "Fuchs". Every rank has three colors associated with it that will form sort of a flag.
